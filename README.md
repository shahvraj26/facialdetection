# ->Welcome to Facial<-
 
 
##### << Remember to Install Python Before you go ahead and do anything >>

##### Python Installation Website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

***Please DO NOT CLICK Anything Except "ClickMe.py", “README.docx”, and "Python Code Running Module.docx"(if needed).***

Before clicking "ClickMe.py" you will have to install pip.
To do that copy the code below into Command Prompt.

"ClickMe.py" will install the packages automatically and slowly, so be patient, and MAKE SURE TO READ THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY IN THE CODE. 
DOUBLE CLICK on "ClickMe.py" and follow the directions.

Below are most of the errors that could possibly happen when running the code:

- Error #1 is the folder "facial" is not on the Desktop:
      
     -	Close "ClickMe.py" and open it again.

     -	Move "facial" to the Desktop immediately.

- Error #2 is "Command Prompt not found":
     
     - I have added a Command Prompt shortcut to the folder, but if you have Mac or Linux the program might not work

     -	If you know how you can change the path of your terminal, but you would have to change some of the code in "ClickMe.py”

     -	If you do not know how to then you can EMAIL ME, or you can see if Mac or Linux allows you to download Windows Command Prompt...

- Error #3 is mouse miss-click:
      
     -	This code uses pyautogui, so it is case-sensitive, and your laptop could be bigger, or your mouse is somewhere else so the code might not work.

     -	If you know how to change the coordinates to match your Command Prompt, then go ahead.
  
     -	If you do not know how then you can EMAIL ME or try to figure it out by searching "pyautogui" online. 

- Error #4 is a missing package:
     
     -	If the code says, "module named ... not found" click "Python Code Running Module.docx" and follow the bottom half instructions and install the packages. 

     -	"Click Me.py" will automatically download the packages needed, but sometimes it fails so you might have to do it manually if the code says, "module named ... not found".

- Error #5 is a CV OPEN:
     
     -	So, when you have the Camera open for one mode, and you do not click q then it will give you an error if you try to join another mode. 

     -	To fix it just click q for one of the modes and exit out of “Click Me.py”

- Sometimes the Code stops:
     
     -	To fix the issue you can close out of "ClickMe.py" and open a new instance or just click Enter.

If an error occurs or the program stops working, it is most likely one of these errors.

To STOP "ClickMe.py" move your mouse to the TOP RIGHT CORNER OF YOUR LAPTOP WINDOW. Or just X out of “Click Me.py”
